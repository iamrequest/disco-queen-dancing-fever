# Disco Queen: Dancing FeVR

Lace up those Vive trackers and get ready to dance until you drop in this funky Dance Dance Revolution inspired VR game! 
When you've mastered the way of the groove, you can load in your own user-generated song and tracks to jam your own way~

## About
 
This was my submission to "[VRJam 2022]([https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-7](https://itch.io/jam/vrjam2022))", an 8 day game jam. The goal for this one was to try out OpenXR/XRToolkit, and to (finally) make a project using the Tundra Trackers I bought ages ago.

You can download the game for free [here, on itch.io]([https://request.itch.io/curse-of-the-pinyaata](https://request.itch.io/disco-queen-dancing-fevr)),
or you can check out my other projects at [request.moe](https://request.moe).

A postmortem for this project, as well as a tutorial on how to make your own custom tracks is on its way in about a week. Check back soon! In the meantime, you can [take a peek to see how I did it myself](./Assets/StreamingAssets/songs).
